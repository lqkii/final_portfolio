        <h1>GSAP R&D
        </h1>
        <h2>For this project, I was initially prompted to create a simple about me page to get familiarized with HTML and CSS. However, I had a concept for the about page which included animations, so I decided to go ahead and learn some basic JS and a library called GSAP to execute on the ideas I had in mind.</h2>
            
        <h2>I thought the outcome ended up pretty successful, as I created a working about page with animations, and learnt the basics of JS and GSAP along the way. Also, it was just satisfying to see that I executed my idea how I originally envisioned it.</h2>
