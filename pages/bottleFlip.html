        <h1>Bottle Flip Game
        </h1>
        <h2>We were given the task of creating a web based “toy”, focusing on the use of javascript. I decided to create a bottle flipping game with the initial plan of using a random number generator to act as the tool for creating the probability of landing a bottle like in real life.</h2>

        <h2>To create the bottle, I used Cinema 4D, modelling it with the reference of an actual waterbottle. Also, I had to use self-taken references to understand the physics of bottle flipping, and tried my best to replicate that in a 3D animation.</h2>
            
        <h2>think that overall it turned out pretty successful, as I achieved the game mechanics while also furthering my skill with 3D animation and modelling. It was really fun to learn a new program and I’m definitely going to revisit this project in the future!</h2>
