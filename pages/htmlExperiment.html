        <h1>Experimenting with HTML
        </h1>
        <h2>This was one of our first projects, based on playing around with HTML tags, and finding cool ways to use them instead of their intended use. I thought it was a pretty fun project since we could just mess around and try different things.</h2>
            
        <h2>The way I went around completing this project was searching through all the HTML tags and seeing if there was any way I could use them in a weird way. Such as using loading bars as eyes for a text based character, or dropdown menus to pace the reading speed of a sentence.</h2>
